		LIKE GOLF!<br>
		ORANGE TILES ARE ORANGE-SCENTED.<br>

		BLUE TILES ARE WATER TILES.<br>
		SWIM THROUGH IF YOU LIKE, BUT...<br>
		IF YOU SMELL LIKE ORANGES!<br>

		THE WATER WILL ALSO ZAP YOU!<br>
		PURPLE TILES ARE SLIPPERY!<br>
		YOU WILL SLIDE TO THE NEXT TILE!<br>
		HOWEVER, THE SLIPPERY SOAP...<br>
